# Arithmatics operator
print(5+2)
print(5-2)
print(5*2)
print(5/2)
print(5//2)# it gives us integer value of result. Ex- 5/2=2.5 but it gives only 2.
print(5%2)# it gives remainder.
print(5**2)# it gives us power like as 5 ke power 2 = 25.

# Shortcut 
# here increment or decrement operator are not valid.
#i++  --> invalid.
#i--  --> invalid.
i = 5
j=2
i = i+2# or
i+=2
i-=2
i*=2
j**=2
print(j)
i/=2 # etc...

# Operator Precedence.

result = 2+3*5
result1 = (2+3)*5
print(result)
print(result1)

# Comparison Operator.
print(3>2)
print(3<2)
print(3>=2)
print(3<=2)
print(3==3)
print(3!=2)
# Logical Operator
print(3>2 or 2>3)
print(3>2 and 4<3)
print(not 3>2) # --> 3>2 is true but result show false because of not operator.
